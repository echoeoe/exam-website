# exam-website

I created the front end of an exam creating, taking, auto-grading, and reviewing website on Andrew File System (a distributed file system) as part of a three-person team for a semester-long, senior project using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and PHP. The project lasted from January to May 2022. 

Screenshots of the webpages are included below.  
What the teacher sees:   
1. This is the login page.

2. This is the teacher landing page.

3. This is the question creation page. Questions are made on the left. On the right, the teacher can search through the pre-existing question bank. They might want to do this to avoid creating duplicate questions or see where the current questions are lacking.

4. This is still the question creation page, but the right side question bank is now populated with pre-existing questions, with no filters in this case.

5. This is the exam creation page. Questions are selected from the question bank on the right, the teacher hits "add selected," and the questions appear on the left. They can then name the exam and hit "submit" to create the exam.

6. This is the page the teacher sees when they review the exam previously seen on the landing page, named "finalTest." Here they can adjust points if, for example, perhaps the autograding was inaccurate or they decide to give partial credit.

7. This is the teacher review page for "finalReleaseTest," the second exam seen on the teacher landing page.

8. This is the teacher review page for "Jess Demo," the third exam seen on the teacher landing page.

What the student sees:  
1. This is the login page the student sees. It's the same one the teacher sees.  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61526855/228390407-80d7cd26-64b7-4ebc-9dd4-33ef3c34e6f9.png)
2. This is the student landing page. It shows a list of exams, their names, and each one displays the option to try to take the exam or view results.

3. All three exams have already been taken once by the student, so if they try to take any one of them again, they land on this page.

4. This is the page the student sees when they review the "finalTest" exam, the first one from their student landing page. It's the same information as what the teacher sees, but with no options to revise or add comments. At the bottom, they can see what the autograding process scored their exam, their final grade after teacher adjustments, and their final grade in percentage format.

The original website is still up and running but requires VPN access. The code is kept in a private repository to prevent copying by current students.
